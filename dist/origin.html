<div class="text bio">&emsp; You're probably wondering, "Graham Crackers and milk? Does that really count as a dish, much less a 
    restaurant?" The answer to all of that is a definitive YES! The sensually incomprable combination of sweet, crunchy Graham
    Crackers with cool, refreshing milk is a cultural dish that has been in the M'GooBoo family for generations. It all started when
    great-grand-M'GooBoo discovered the combination on his own, with no one else's help, back in the ancient year of 2017. Since then, 
    he made it his goal to perfect the dish, vowing to consume exclusively that and Mountain Dew Code Red. As a result, Graham Crackers and 
    Milk, as both a delicacy and a restaurant, were born.
